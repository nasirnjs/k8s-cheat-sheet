## How to merge Kubernetes kubectl config files into one for use MultiCluster or Switching contexts.
When dealing with multiple Kubernetes clusters, merge their kubeconfig files into a single configuration file ($HOME/.kube/config). This facilitates context switching using kubectl config use-context <context-name>, streamlining the management of configurations for seamless multi-cluster operations.

The KUBECONFIG environment variable is a list of paths to configuration files.\
`export KUBECONFIG=second-cluster-kubeconfig.yaml:config.back`

Merge all kubeconfig files into one.\
`kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/config`

Updates the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point to the new configuration file at `~/.kube/config`. This is the file that was just updated in the previous step.\
`export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config`

Display a list of available contexts in the Kubernetes configuration. A context in Kubernetes is a combination of a cluster, user, and namespace.\
`kubectl config get-contexts`

To switch to a different context in your Kubernetes configuration.\
`kubectl config use-context aes-cluster-1`
